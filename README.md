# TrumpSentiments
This project was inspired by the show Planet Money's episode #763:BOTUS Where they hire a firm to analyse trumps tweets and buy stock dependent on them. This version does not buy or sell stocks, but simply analyses new tweets from the president and inserts them into a text file. 
# Dependencies 
 1. Tweepy
